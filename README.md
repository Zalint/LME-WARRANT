## Mathematical Framework

The calculators implement the mathematical reconciliation between:

### Trader's View (Conceptual)
- **Component 1**: Weight Differential P&L = (P_wj - P_wi) √ó (W - U)
- **Component 2**: Futures Spread P&L = (P_Fj - P_Fi) √ó U

### M View (System)
- **Pickup Leg**: Future P&L = U √ó (P_wi - P_Fi), Warrant = 0
- **Delivery Leg**: Future P&L = -U √ó (P_wj - P_Fj), Warrant P&L = W √ó (P_wj - P_wi)

Both methods produce identical results, ensuring perfect reconciliation.

## Variables
- **W**: Physical warrant weight (MT)
- **U**: Standard futures lot size (25 MT per contract)
- **P_Fi**: Future price at pickup
- **P_wi**: Warrant price at pickup  
- **P_Fj**: Future price at delivery
- **P_wj**: Warrant price at delivery

## Date Formats
The application follows the user's preference for date formats:
- Input: YYYY-MM-DD (HTML5 date picker)
- Display: DD/MM/YYYY
- Excel export: DD/MM/YYYY

## Excel Export
